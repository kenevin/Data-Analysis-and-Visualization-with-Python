# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-with-Python
Classwork, notes and completed homework assignments from NYC Data Science Academy course.

I completed an in-person course through NYC Data Science Academy on Data Analysis and Visualization with Python.
This course was taught over five weekends and culminated with a project of my choosing. 
This course focused on developing proficiency and skills with key data structures, analytics and visualization packages in Python.
Some of the material covered in the class was data frames, numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. 
Graduation from the course required completing each homework assignment. The class notes and homework assignments are included here.

I also chose to complete the optional capstone project. The Python notebook for my final project is included in this repository as well.
For my final project, I chose to write a Python script to analyze historical weather data in various cities. The data set had over 8 million 
rows of data from which I selected important data sets and presented an analysis and multiple visualizations of the results.
